## Index

### SimCompanies
[SimCompanies](https://www.simcompanies.com/) a business simulation strategy game aimed at giving you the fun and experience of managing a company using real world economic principles.



## Project introduction
This is a personal project that I will be doing in my free time that aims to improve my understanding on how a stock market works in an online game and learning python programming language. At the moment this project is still in its early stages of development and some of the principles may change or evolve in the future. 

## Project goal
The goal of this project is to create a stock exchange on an online game called [simcompanies](https://www.simcompanies.com/) that will use [discord](https://discord.com) as a
platform for players to reach out to potential buyers. At the time of this writing, the game does not have a fully functioning stock exchange or stock market and there are no
plans to implement a system for the time being.
