### Index

#### Jupyter Notebook
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an incredibly powerful tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects. 

### Introduction
This is a personal project that was completed in early November 2020 as a tool to learn fundamental concepts of data science by web scrapping data from [futbin](https://www.futbin.com/). This project is in line with futbin's [terms of service](https://www.futbin.com/tos).

### Review
The file "FIFA Player Lookout.ipynb" can be downloaded freely however as I do not provide any support after the completion of this project, there may be missing dependancies that you need to install in order for you to run this tool. If you do not wish to install, I have attached photos in this repository for you to review this tool.
