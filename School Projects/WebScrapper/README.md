## Project Scenario 2 

Best Cyber Pte Ltd has just clinched a deal from an important client ABWeb Pte Ltd. The project is to create an application to perform penetration testing on their website to determine vulnerability. ABWeb believes that Python is one of the most appropriate programming languages for to be used for pen-testing. 

ABWeb is expecting to use Python to create script(s) to perform the first two step of pen-testing namely reconnaissance and mapping. Being an experienced Pen-Tester, you have been tasked to work with two other cyber-security specialists to develop a script to perform the task. 

The script should include test cases, results and technical documentation for this project. 

### Tasks 

  1. Create a project named DA_<Group Name> with script(s) to use Python version 3.0 or higher.
  2. The project should include Version Control Systems (VCS) for team collaboration. The team is expected to demonstrate on how to create or update project and script(s) to VCS (Github). 
  3. The project should import appropriate libraries in the script. 
  4. The uniform resource locator should be correctly defined for the imported library class to retrieve the relevant data.  
  5. The script needs to demonstrate the following reconnaissance procedure: 
    i.  Perform a “get” request on the given website 
    ii.  Display an “OK” return status 
    iii.  Display the Website header 
    iv.  Modify the Header user-agent to display “Mobile” 
  6. Modify the script to perform mapping on the website in the following manner: 
    i.  Use Scrapy web-crawler with appropriate parser “response.css” 
    ii.  Display reference webpage 
    iii.  Store the retrieve information in JSON 
  7. Perform the modification to the script to recursively extract JPG images on all known links. Display the list of image links. 
  8. The project should also include a Test Case with appropriate Test function(s) to test your application.  

  Finally, a presentation is required to share your insights.

  ### Install
To install this web scrapper, download DA_Group7(Comopleted) folder in this repository. It is recommended to use pycharms if you want to modify its parameteres.
