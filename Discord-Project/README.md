# Discord Project

### Index

#### Discord.py
[Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html) is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord. 

#### SimCompanies
[SimCompanies](https://www.simcompanies.com/) a business simulation strategy game aimed at giving you the fun and experience of managing a company using real world economic principles.

### Introduction
This is a personal project that I will be doing in my free time that aims to improve my understanding on how a stock market works in an online game and learning python programming language. The source code of the project is named TestBot.py and the database is bank.json. At the moment this project is still in its early stages of development and some of the principles may change or evolve in the future. 

### Project goal
The goal of this project is to create a stock exchange on an online game called [simcompanies](https://www.simcompanies.com/) that will use [discord](https://discord.com) as a
platform for players to reach out to potential buyers. At the time of this writing, the game does not have a fully functioning stock exchange or stock market and there are no
plans to implement a system for the time being. This will be a free to use platform for all users in the game. 

### Project features
Currently basic features include a virtual bank account, a marketplace and price tracker has been implemented in a private discord server. Real time data is extracted using the game's API at a 5 minute interval in line with the game's [terms of service](https://www.simcompanies.com/articles/api). All reference materials I used can be found online platforms such as YouTube, Google, GitHub and Stack Overflow. I intend to implement a graph to display volume trades and market average in the future so that users can use it as a tool to assist them with decision making of buying shares of other companies.
